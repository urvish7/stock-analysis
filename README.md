# Stock-analysis by using VBA 

## Overview and Background of Project
Steve interested in the workbook that been prepared. At the clicking of a button, he can examine a whole dataset as per year. Now, to dig little more into this, for his dad and mom, he wants to amplify the dataset to consist of the whole stock marketplace over the previous few years. However it seems like the execution of the code is slow. 

## The purpose of project

 The agenda of this project is to edit the code using all the data one time in order to fetch the same information and determine wheather after editing the code it made the script faster.
 
 
 
 ### The 2017 Data
  For 2017 worksheet we had a lot data to do analysis for that  particular year. The data was recorded on daily bases and we have to summarize the data to give the analysis. The data is categorize among daily Opening and closing price also, with the high and low. Inorder to jump on the analysis we have taken the daily volume data, as shown in output.

 The total daily volume is evalulated of the individual stocks and inrespect to that the return is recorded. Inorder to filter at best we have color filtered the column. The Red zones indicates that the returns are receiving in losses or negative so we know its a loss stock however if it stats green that means it is returning in a positive manner and givng profits.
 
### The 2018 Data
  For 2018 Data, it is followed with the same approach as the 2017, having similar kind of the data in the sheet. We filtered it with total daily volume in order to analyze the return on each particular stock. As shown in the figure we have created the 2 columns inorder to do calculations on performance.

  The returns are calculated in terms of the total daily volumes as per figure. In order to filter the results in a proper visual manner they are color coded. Red signifies that the returns are in negative number or its in loss however, the Green color signifies that it is in positive number or showing profits.
  
  
## The comparision between 2017 and 2018

  The 2017 filtered data shows major area covered in green compare to the 2018 filtered data which indicates that the return of the profits in 2017 was more than 2018. We can conclude that the 2017 year was more successful than 2018.
  
## The time frame to run the code
   On the both pictures there is a screen shots of the time frame calculated to execute the code. It is the main purpose of the project to minimize the time calculation for the execution of the code. We can tell from the picture that the time taken to execute the code for 2018 is less than 2017 data.
   
## Summary

 The newly modified code is with  loop structures and advanced synatax formatting pattern which helps in reducing the execution time of the code. Instead of going line to line coding these syntax reduces the number of lines and makes the compiling faster. All in all we can say that by working on the code and reducing the lines by using the syntaxes it reduces the time and makes calculation faster. 
 
## Advantages and disadvantages of refactoring code in general. 
 There are certainly pros and cons to the refactoring the code in general , here are few :
 
   Pros: 
   
   - More we work on code to reduces the line and make it simple, the faster it gets in execution which reduces the time.
   - Reworking on the code gives better understanding of the code and makes the coder to do in more creative ways.
          
   Cons:
   
   - Remaking the code sometimes lead to adding more complexity in the code.
   - Also, in order to make it better, we end up with never ending loop of errors.



## Advantages and disadvantages of the original and refactored VBA script.
   Advantages of orginal VBA Script:
   - Having abandon data on the sheet to evalute the data which also gives opportunity to see what other factors are affecting. 
  
   Disadvantages of Orginal VBA Script:  
   - Taking a lot time to execute.
  
   Advantage of the refactored VBA script: 
   - Executes the code in less time. Have better summarized data. Filters better.   
  
   Disadvantages of the refactored  VBA Script:
   - Evaluates on the basis of few data. Sometimes other factors may affects the output.
